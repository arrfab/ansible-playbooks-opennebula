============================

Ansible playbooks/tasks to deploy opennebula
The opennebula playbook contains two plays : 
* first one will setup the frontend
* second one will install required packages on each hypervisor node
This is just a start and need the following Fixes :
* integrate the oneadmin ssh pub key on each hypervisor node
* and more to come ... :-)
